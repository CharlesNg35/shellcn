## Module Development

When adding new modules:

1. Create module directory in `internal/modules/`
2. Register permissions in `permissions.go` with `init()`
3. Follow existing module patterns (see SSH module)
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation

## Permission System

All new features must use the permission system:

- Define permission dependencies correctly
- Use middleware for API route protection
- Test permission checks
